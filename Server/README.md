### Important

Create a file in the same folder as this file with the name "Credentials.h" and add and change the following code to be able to connect to your Wi-Fi network:

```
#define UN "your-ssid-username"
#define PW "your-ssid-password"
```

Add the file "SigmaStudioFW.h" from your "C:\Program Files\Analog Devices\SigmaStudio 4.x" folder here also (overwrite the existing one with your latest version).
